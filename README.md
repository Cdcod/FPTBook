Sure, here's a sample review and instructions on how to clone and set up your repository:

**Review:**
Your bookstore web application, built using ASP.NET Core, is a robust and user-friendly platform that effectively caters to the needs of book enthusiasts. The intuitive user interface, coupled with efficient search functionality, ensures a seamless browsing experience. The categorization of books by genre, author, and popularity is a thoughtful feature that aids in navigation. The secure and swift checkout process enhances the overall user experience. However, there is always room for improvement. Incorporating user reviews and ratings for the books could provide prospective buyers with valuable insights. 

**Instructions to clone and set up the repository:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repository-url>

# Navigate into the directory
cd <your-repository-name>

# If you're using a specific branch, switch to it
git checkout <your-branch-name>

# Restore the dependencies and tools of a project
dotnet restore

# Build the project and its dependencies
dotnet build

# Run the project
dotnet run
```
Please replace `<your-repository-url>`, `<your-repository-name>`, and `<your-branch-name>` with your actual repository URL, repository name, and branch name respectively. 

Remember, you need to have Git and .NET Core SDK installed on your machine to execute these commands. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the README file in your repository or the official ASP.NET Core documentation.
